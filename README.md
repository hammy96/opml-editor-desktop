# opml-editor-desktop
OPML Editor desktop version

DESKTOP VERSION
* Much longer text allowed
* Can wrap to multiple lines
* Almost any length of text possible
* formatNode() function has been extracted into a separate function making it much easier to develop with chatbot
* However the source code has been "reprocessed" by chatbot and hasn't been thoroughly tested (unlike opml-editor) eg "Show children only" does something matching its name but not what I originally intended (easy to fix though)
